# GitHub Blog - Control+Z (WordPress Project)

This WordPress blog was created as a personal project to **learn WordPress as a CMS**, using the Astra theme and a custom child theme. The content of the blog focuses on **GitHub tutorials and resources for beginners**.

## Project Overview
- The majority of the customization was done **directly through the Astra theme and WordPress customizer** (colors, typography, layouts, menus, widgets, etc.).
- Some additional effects and styling were added using custom CSS.
- Implemented a GitHub API integration to display my GitHub repositories on the "About Me" page.
- Hosted on InfinityFree, a free web hosting service.

## Features
- Beginner-friendly GitHub tutorials and guides.
- Custom child theme built on Astra.
- Simple and responsive design.
- GitHub repository showcase on the About page.
- Additional minor styling and effects via CSS.

## What this repository is (and is not)
✔️ Shows the child theme structure and some custom code 
✔️ Includes custom CSS and the GitHub API functionality  
❌ Does NOT include the WordPress database, media files, or plugins  
❌ It is NOT intended to fully recreate the website by installing the theme

⚠️ ***Note: Most of the blog's settings, posts, and media are stored in the WordPress database. Installing the child theme alone will **not replicate the full blog content**. This repository mainly showcases the custom theme, styling, and API integration.***
